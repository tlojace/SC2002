# SC2002 / CE2002 / CZ2002  
Object-Oriented Design & Programming Assignment

This project was built in **November 2024** for the SC2002/CE2002/CZ2002 course.  
Although originally intended as a group assignment, all design, implementation, and testing were **completed independently**.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out or connect with me on LinkedIn.
